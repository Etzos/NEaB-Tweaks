# About

This is just a somewhat simple script that fixes a few problems with NEaB. Namely:

* Add a combat view which is widescreen friendly
* Make the combat screen "movable"
* Dim the HP and MP bars in combat when the mouse is over them
* Fix the hotkey bug with combat causing it to load strangely
* Make the Journal sortable by most recent date instead of alphabetically
